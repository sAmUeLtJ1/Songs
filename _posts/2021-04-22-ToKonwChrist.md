## To Know Christ

*A sharing by Helen Chang for this song:*

I first heard of the name of the Lord Jesus at school and the impression I gained was all about his love for me personally! It was a very self-centred thought especially for a person like me living in a family with broken relationships. More than 10 years later as I began to know the truth of God’s salvation for me through the Lord Jesus, only then did I begin to realise the meaning of getting to know Christ. When I first read Paul’s statement, “But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ..”([Gal.6:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gal.6.14)), it sounded like a declaration in the face of a life and death issue! No wonder he also experienced the path to life through Christ such that he aimed to be conformed to the death of Christ so that he may attain the resurrection from the dead like Christ ([Phil.3:10-11](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Phil.3.10-11)). 

How precious it is for me to have a glimpse into Paul’s spirit such that it could help to set my value system aright in life. 

So to know the love of Christ is to know him crucified. Only in living a life when the “I” is being crucified to the world, would I be able to pass on such love to others also.
