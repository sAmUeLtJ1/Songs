*A sharing by Helen Chang for this song:*

At times when I ponder on this issue, I would be lost for words because I do not know of any appropriate words to describe  and to express the little I have come to experience of God’s greatness  and graciousness! Even so, I have always been amazed at His firmness in  keeping to His principles yet at the same time He is responsive to the  ways we relate to Him. It means that He has a flexibility within the  principle of His all wise dealings with us.

That is why the more I have come to experience Yahweh’s patience and  firmness, the more I am in awe of His greatness and meekness at the same time! Observing the ways He dealt with the Israelites in the Old  Testament, the ways with which the Lord Jesus expressed his Father’s  heart in dealing with the weak, the sinners, these show me the many  wonders of Who Yahweh is indeed! Just to focus on the fact that the God  of all creation, the perfectly holy One, would stretch out His hand to  reach a sinner, how incredible beyond all imagination is His compassion! How I am eternally grateful that “He has not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor punished us according to our iniquities” ([Psalm 103:10](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ps 103.10)) as He is granting everyone an opportunity to turn back to Him in  repentance! His loving kindness is for the first timer as well as for  anyone who has been estranged by hidden sin. Who is like Him indeed!

*Helen Chang 为这首歌的分享：*

有时，当我思考这个问题时，我会不知所措，因为我不知道有什么合适的词来形容和表达我对上帝的伟大和恩典的一点点体验！  即便如此，我一直惊讶于他坚定地遵守他的原则，同时他对我们与他的关系方式做出回应。  这意味着他在他与我们一切明智的交往原则中具有灵活性。 

所以我越是体会到雅伟的忍耐和刚强，就越同时敬畏他的伟大和温柔！ 看看旧约中雅伟对待以色列人的方式，主耶稣对待软弱罪人的方式，表达了他父的心意，这让我看到了雅伟是谁！  单单关注创造万物的上帝，独一完全圣洁的上帝，会伸手接触罪人，他的怜悯是何等的不可思议！  我永远感激“他没有按我们的罪过待我们，也没有按我们的罪孽惩罚我们”（ [诗篇 103:10 ](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ps 103.10)），因为他给了每个人一个机会转向他悔改！ 他的慈爱是对第一次来的，也是对任何因隐藏的罪而疏远的人。 谁真的像他！
