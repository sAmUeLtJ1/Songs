## Jesus, Lamb of God

*A sharing by Helen Chang for this song:*

While the Lord Jesus is known to be the Lamb which God Yahweh had prepared for the salvation of mankind ([I Pet.1:19-20](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1 Pet.1.19-20)), it is still mind boggling to realise that, in fact, Christ Jesus willingly laid down his life in accordance with God’s plan! Since we know that without the shedding of blood of a perfect offering there is no forgiveness of sin ([Heb. 9:22](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Heb. 9.22)), so without the obedience of Christ learnt through his suffering ([Heb.5:8](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Heb.5.8)) he could not have been a perfect sacrifice for us! While I am eternally grateful for the life which he had laid down for me, as indeed for us all, I am equally grateful for the example of his life such that I could follow him in his footsteps by God’s enabling. 

​	Since I have freely received such mercy in abundance, so I will continue to live a life that befits such deep gratitude from my heart to lead others to know Christ Jesus as the Lamb of God for their salvation also!
