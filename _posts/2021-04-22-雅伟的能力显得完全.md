## 雅伟的能力显得完全

*A sharing by Helen Chang on how this song came to be composed:*

I wonder if you, like me, would agree with the Chinese idiom that it’s far easier to move a mountain than to change a person’s character. That was so until I began to experience the reality of [II Cor. 12:9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2 Cor. 12.9) a few decades ago. Apparently it was in the areas in which I felt the weakest where I would begin to know God’s enabling grace and power the most. I used to have the fear of failure and being looked down on! Yet once I began to realise that I’m only a steward of the life that’s been entrusted to me, it dawned on me that He who is faithful to His word would do exactly what He says! But I, on my part, must co-operate and not shy away from it! It’s on this reality that I’ve begun to dare to do some things in which I’ve no confidence at all. So what a joyful Hope and Privilege for the weak like me!
